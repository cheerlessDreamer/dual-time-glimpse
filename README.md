# Dual Time Glimpse

A modern web application that displays both standard time and decimal time side by side. This project provides an interactive way to compare our conventional 24-hour time system with the decimal time system, featuring both digital and analog clock displays.

## About Decimal Time

Decimal time (also known as French Revolutionary Time) was introduced during the French Revolution as part of a larger attempt to decimalize various types of measurements. In this system:

- The day is divided into 10 hours
- Each hour contains 100 minutes
- Each minute contains 100 seconds

This means that:
- 1 decimal hour = 2.4 standard hours
- 1 decimal minute = 1.44 standard minutes
- 1 decimal second = 0.864 standard seconds

The system was officially introduced in France on November 24, 1793, but was suspended by Napoleon on April 7, 1795, and was officially abandoned in 1806. Although it didn't gain widespread adoption, it represents a fascinating attempt to rationalize time measurement using the decimal system.

## Features

- Real-time display of both standard and decimal time
- Interactive analog clock faces
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive design
- 12/24-hour format toggle for standard time
